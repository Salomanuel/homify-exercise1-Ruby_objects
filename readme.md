# Exercise​ ​1​ ​-​ ​Ruby:​ ​Object​ ​Inheritance

In Ruby, write an "Animal" class that is initialized with a "name" argument. 

It should have a method that allows retrieving the name of the instance. 

It should also have the signature for a "talk" method
which is not implemented -- use your best judgement to decide what should happen if this method is called.	

Then, create two more classes, "Cat" and "Dog" that inherit from and implement Animal's method --
so when they talk, cats say "Meow" and dogs "Woof".
